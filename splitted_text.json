Free cash flow* increased by 68% YoY to $30.6 billion and the Company continues to strengthen its balance sheet, with the gearing ratio* reducing to 8.0% at March 31, 2022 from 14.2% at December 31, 2021. The decrease in gearing was a result of higher cash and cash equivalents, primarily attributable to stronger operating cash flows and cash proceeds in connection with Aramco’s gas pipeline transaction.\nIn line with the Company’s prudent financial framework and focus on capital flexibility, Aramco decreased its total borrowings principally through a prepayment to the Public Investment Fund in January, therefore reducing the total outstanding principal amount of Promissory Notes by $8 billion originally issued in connection with the acquisition of a 70% stake in SABIC. This resulted in a reduction in financing costs.",
